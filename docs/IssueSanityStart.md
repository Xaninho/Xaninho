When trying to run 'sanity start' to run de localhost of sanity, a similar error message might popup: 

"When you run a .ps1 PowerShell script you might get the message saying â€œ.ps1 is not digitally signed. The script will not execute on the system."

To fix it you have to run the command below to run Set-ExecutionPolicy and change the Execution Policy setting.

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
